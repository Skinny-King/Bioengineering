messenger RNA \textbf{mRNA}   & code for proteins \\
ribosomal RNA \textbf{rRNA}   & form core of ribosom structure and catalize protein synthesis \\
micro RNA \textbf{miRNA} & regulate gene expression\\
transfer RNA \textbf{tRNA} & serve as adaptors between mRNA and amino acids during protein synthesis \\
other non-coding RNA & RNA splicing, gene regulation, telomere maintenance, etc. \\
