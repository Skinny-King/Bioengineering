Mimic in vivo conditions so that cells can grow.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Biology:} including cells and growth factors
    \item \textbf{Material / Scaffold:} including hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties
    \item \textbf{Engineering tools:} including bioreactors, microfabrication, bioprinting, and perfusion systems
\end{itemize}

Hydrogel as ECM mimics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hydrophilic networks with tunable mechanical, biochemical and physiochemical properties.
    \item Matrices can be natural, engineered or hybrid.
    \item Body tissues have different matrix properties.
\end{itemize}
