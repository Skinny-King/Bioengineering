\textbf{Differentiated cells} in adult organisms contain all the genetic information to form a new organism.
But, they express \textbf{only a fraction} of genes \textbf{specific to their function}.\\

Stem cells can differentiate to tissue-specific cell, but also renew themselves.\\

\textbf{Pluripotent stem cells} can give rise to all cell types.\\
\textbf{Multipotent stem cells} can give rise to a limited number of cell types tissue specific.\\
