Fibrous elements outside the cell that hold cells and tissues together

Functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Structural support and mechanical scaffold
    \item Resistance to stretch and compression
    \item Boundary between tissues
    \item Water retention
    \item Reservoir for signaling molecules
\end{itemize}
Plants have cell walls (cellulose and pectin) instead of ECM.
