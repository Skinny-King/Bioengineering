All the bacteria and microbes within the GI tract.\\
\textbf{Functions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Barrier integrity
    \item Mucus production
    \item Food metabolism
    \item Transform food products into chemicals that act as \textbf{signaling molecules}.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Dysregulation:}\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Leads to diseases (ex: anxiety, depression, insulin resistance, etc)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Solutions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Probiotics}: bacteria that metabolize food
        sources into signals that regulate
        \textbf{homeostasis} in body.
    \item Design \textbf{microphysiological models} (eg. OoaC) that
        capture the interactions between the gut
        microbiome intestinal cells.
\end{itemize}
