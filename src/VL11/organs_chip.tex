Micro-tissues grown in a controlled
microfluidic device where \textbf{physical} and
\textbf{mechanical stimulation} can be applied. OoaC are patient-specific (gender, age, history
of disease, etc).\\

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Controllable flow circuits
        \item Multiple tissue compartments
        \item Multiple cell types
        \item On-demand drug release
        \item Small scale but high-throughput
    \end{itemize}
Testing:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item interaction between different cell types
        \item safety in wholeisitc concept
        \item Measure uptake and clearance rates
    \end{itemize}
