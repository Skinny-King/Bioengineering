Consists of using
engineering tools and principles to investigate
and modulate the \textbf{immune system}.\\

Applications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Evade or delay immune response
    \item Shut off auto-immunity in auto-immune diseases
    \item Stimulate immune response (e.g. vaccines)
    \item Multiply native immune response (T cell activation)
\end{itemize}
